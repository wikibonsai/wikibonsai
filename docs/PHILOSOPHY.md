# Guiding Philosophy

Every action we take follows a (sub)consciously plotted course which moves us in some direction. Here lies a constellation of philosophical "(north) stars" that guide the direction of the WikiBonsai project.

## Information Organization

With the explosion of information that came with the information age, many were more than happy to offload the work of organizing it all to someone else; to type in a textbox and be presented with a list of results, or better yet, answers. But reality is more complicated than a simple search box. Making sense of the world is humanity's collective responsibility and every individual has a unique perspective to contribute to the distributed network of sense-making that is our collective understanding.

## Learning Loops

One of the quirky bits of human nature is that once we learn something, it [becomes invisible to us][utb-gorilla-exp], rendering articulation of that understanding difficult or impossible. Rather than "consulting an expert", it is actually the student that may hold the key to capturing knowledge. The note-taking of a student and the communication with a teacher is a continuous conversational loop which may be harnessed: To capture knowledge as it is explicated by the student, verified against the understanding of the teacher, and then preserved for posterity.

## Studying To Tile The World

In higher education, the pressure to "publish or perish" can sometimes obscure the true purpose of institutions. This project contends that education is like a [tiling problem][wiki-penrose], where the goal is to design tiles that fit together and cover a given space while minimizing the number of tiles needed to cover the maximum surface area. These "tiles" might be thought of as concepts we know and "space" might be observable phenomena in the world. Research is the process of shaping these "tiles" to cover the allotted "space" -- to develop a comprehensive and coherent understanding of the world around us.

## Augment My Mind

Technology conjures up images of solved problems and automated workloads, but when it comes to creating a technical or digital interface for the mind it seems that replacing functionality is something we should be wary of. WikiBonsai takes the view that augmenting the mind should not only extend and add potential, but exercise what's already there. It seems wise to build augmented intelligence systems that act as a go-between. Interfacing with the system should not only provide augmentation of capability, but simultaneously exercise your mind to improve its inherent abilities.

## A Jungle Gym For Thought

If you were to build a system that improved your thinking simply by interacting with it, what might it look like? How could we create a "jungle gym for the thought" where the more you play, the stronger your mind gets?

Three points come to mind:

- Breakdown words and their relationships to understand their meaning.
- Practice verbalization and crafting trains of thought.
- Communicating with others and updating based on feedback (loops).

Like most text editors, WikiBonsai leaves room for all of the above to be explored: You could easily save an essay (where we fleshed out a train of thought) or email (with some feedback) in the system and it is meant to make the meanings of connections between them all readily apparent. But the focus is really on the first point: Words and their meaning.

## Word Resurrection

When we use a word do we really know what it means? What else is there besides a dictionary definition? The set of workflows in this project are guided by a process of developing deeper meaning around the words we use.

When you first encounter a word you don't know, in a sense, it's "dead to you". It's a zombie of your language, and by extension your culture, and will remain (un)dead to you until you've explored it: Until you narrow down its possibilities, probabilities, and uncover its place in a wider context. Only then can it come back to life after you've "played with it" -- think about, connect, and integrate it into your body of knowledge.

In this way, one may breathe new life into language.

## The Garden

WikiBonsai is a kind of ["digital garden"][site-digital-gardeners] where you can tend, weed, water, and [plot out a patch of personal space][wibomd-doc-story--walled-gardens]. It's a place to demarcate the line between what you've explored and what you've not, to munch on food for thought and understand what's begot. By cultivating a digital garden, the concepts and ideas inside can cross-pollinate to stimulate growth of all kinds and break down knowledge silos between topics, categories, and fields.

Stronger connections can begin germinating the root of a more systematic order...

## The Tree

WikiBonsai's central structure is a "semantic tree", which is a personal tree of knowledge. It provides an over-arching organizational framework for the systematic integration of new words and concepts. This in turn can ameliorate and explicitly address overspecialization based on the shape of one's tree.

The tree is also called a "knowledge bonsai", because "bonsai" is a beautiful recreation of nature in miniature form. This is a deliberate acknowledgement of our own limitations as individuals: We may never be able to completely understand everything, but we can certainly clean up some mess around us and cultivate something beautiful within our realm of responsibility.

## Babel

Words are powerful tools, but they lose their usefulness when they become mutually unintelligible. How can we avoid the erosion of shared meaning when building ever higher towers of abstraction?

The hope is that the tree structure may provide a way to calculate corresponding meaning between different trees based on a word's branch path; from root to leaf. This way, there is redundancy for human knowledge since truth is not stemming from a single source and is instead calculated from a distributed forest of knowledge trees. This also provides flexibility, allowing everyone to have their own [divergences from the mainstream][pst-git-branch] where appropriate.

Perhaps one day, there could be a larger communal tree, a sort of "[hometree][hometree]", could be computationally derived from the distributed forest of personal bonsais. People could congregate to compare and contrast their different branch patterns or leaves, and mitigate the risk of building an ever taller Tower of Babel.

Until such a day, it is **strongly** recommended that external references such as Wikipedia, Britannica, or your choice of common cultural reference point, is regularly visited when constructing the semantic tree. After all, **meanings of words are meant to be mutually intelligible and shared with others, otherwise they are meaningless.**

## Abundant Meaning

Meanings of words are fluid[^internet]. They can change and evolve over time and this process of evolution may be rooted in the connections described above: As relationships between words grow or wither like roots or branches of a tree, the makeup of meaning shifts and may even transform completely like soil beneath our feet. Meaningfulness flourishes when there are deep, long-term connections, while meaninglessness sets in when those same connections are broken or are too fluid to prevent the erosion of meaning.

And, for what it's worth, meaning in life may not be all that much different.

## Finding Free Will...

WikiBonsai maintains neutrality when it comes to the big questions about free will and deterministic or indeterminate reality. However this project also maintains that regardless of the scenario we find ourselves in, there are likely certain preconditions necessary for free will to manifest. For example, "informed consent" is recognized as a necessary prerequisite for making fully informed decisions, which may be viewed as an extension of exercising one's free will.

This project keeps in mind a few of those possible preconditions with a particular focus on preserving integrity of the individual, the environment, and the individual's relationship to said environment.

### Freedom From Influence (For The Individual)

As social creatures, we are very easily influenced and easily influence others. Thus, it is paramount that we have opportunities to ponder in private and think in solitude. This project deals primarily with raw text (markdown) so that handling one's own data on their own computer or system is an easy task, but also remains easily transferrable between systems. No data is collected from a person's notes (though other frameworks' and applications' privacy policies will need to be evaluated separately).

### Freedom From Censorship (Of The Environment)

The following is a [precise definition of "censorship"][twt-censorship]:

> "the restriction of the _public expression_ of or _public access_ to information by _authority_ when the information is thought to have the capacity to undermine the authority by making it **accountable** to the public."
> 
> ~ Censored by Molly Roberts

The following is a definition of "censorship" with respect to information space:

> Given an information space, with a coordinate system mutually agreed upon by all participating agents, where each unique coordinate maps to a unique piece of information, censorship would include:
> 
> - The nonconsensual distortion or deletion of the coordinate system.
> - The total blockage or restricted movement to or between any points in that space.
> - The disallowance of departing the given information space.
> - The disallowance of improving the information's concordance with observed reality.

This project aims to provide tools for individuals to build such information spaces and evangelize this definition of censorship, which is more precise than is typical and helps uncover concrete courses of action to address censorship.

### Independence of Orientation (Of The Individual In The Environment)

Wikipedia, while it has its issues, has been [lauded as an overall success][econ-wiki] in the face of recommendation algorithms[^soc-dil]. The reason for this is deceptively simple: Pages do not change from user to user and the location of a page does not typically change. **Mutually agreed upon coordinate systems** in information space and **fixed coordinates** for the information is fundamental for the ability to orient onesself and to find anything. (The [Dewey Decimal System][dewey-decimal] is another successful example of an informational coordinate system that uses fixed coordinates) Only once these principles are applied can one roam freely...

### Right To Roam[^roam] (Of The Individual Through The Environment)

Recommendation algorithms and internet search today is [like a librarian][utb-internet-search] at the entrance of a vast digital library. It helpfully asks, "What can I find for you?" and dutifully retrieves _personalized_ results. But in this system, we are never allowed inside: We don't have a reliable means of verifying what is or is not in our digital library. What's worse, is that the removal of right to roam information space could mean the death of creativity, because a fundamental ingredient to creativity is serendipity: The **accidental** discovery of something or some connection. But **accidental discoveries cannot happen if you can only ever find precisely what you were looking for.**

When we made the transition from analog to digital we lost the freedom to roam the stacks and, in so doing, lost some of the wonder of the library[^wonder-except].

## ...In The Face of AI

We are about to make another innovative leap [from internet search to AI chatbots][econ-ai-search], thereby reifying our [little digital librarians][utb-internet-search]. It is this project's hope that these newer means of search act as additions, [rather than substitutions][sydney-bing], to coherent and navigable information spaces. May we hope beyond hope that this dramatic disruption in technology can provide an opportunity to rediscover some of the fundamentals that have been eroding away beneath our feet.

## Child-Like, But Wise

> "We shall not cease from exploration,
> And the end of all our exploring,
> Will be to arrive where we started,
> And know the place for the first time."
> 
> ~ [T.S. Elliot][utb-know-return]

In the beginning, WikiBonsai was only about learning and education: "How can I take better notes? How can I understand more deeply?" But in the end, maybe it was about discovering what free will might really mean...

So when any child asks, "Why are we learning this?" perhaps we should tell them: Because **we are only as free as the space that we have explored and made sense of.**[^portal]
